### Project Overview
*PTI Repairs* is a website landing page to reinforce a campaign initiative by People's Trust Insurance. The purpose of the campaign is to inform homeowner's about PTI's unique service offering. Most home insurance companies require you, as the policyholder, to figure out how you will repair damage when you file a claim... they just write you a check and check out. With People's Trust, they save you the hassle of finding a contractor, getting price quotes and coordinating all the repairs yourself. Basically, they insure and repair... you relax.

### Objectives
* Build awareness for unique approach of insurance model
* Generate more sales leads
* Create an online tool for finding an insurance agent

### Work Involved
I developed the "Find an Agent" tool, which showcased on the landing page and on the main PTI website. By visiting the "Find an Agent" page, your location is automatically detected (with the help of the *HTML5 geolocation API*) and a list of local authorized agencies are displayed. You can also search for agencies by zip code. The *Google Maps API* is used to pinpoint the latitude/ longitude location for each agency address. Clicking "contact" will allow you to send a message direcly to the agency, to initiate direct conversation.
