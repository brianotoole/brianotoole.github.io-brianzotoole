Outside of work, I keep up with sports as much a I can – particularly, the NFL. There's nothing quite like a Sunday afternoon in December when your favorite team is in the playoff hunt. Well, in my case, when you’re wishing your team is in the playoff hunt. Yes, I’m a Jacksonville Jaguars fan. And it’s been a tough life. Since 2010, the Jaguars haven’t won more than 5 games and have consistently become a joke for NFL analysts.

Flash forward to 2016 and you might say the tables have turned. With the Jags’ able to snatch some big names in Free Agency, in addition to grabbing Jalen Ramsey and Myles Jack (Yes, BOTH) in the 2016 NFL Draft, there’s talk of a new era in Jacksonville. Can the Jaguars capitalize on the improvements to the player personel? Will the Jaguars make the playoffs? That remains to be seen; however, I can say for the first time in a LONG TIME, we are excited as a fan base.

That said, I created a website experience to showcase the recent draft picks – [http://movethosechains.com](http://movethosechains.com){:target="_blank"}. If you’ve ever been to a Jags game, you’ll understand the meaning behind “Move Those Chains.” But, for those who have not… it’s a [chant](https://m.fanchants.com/football-songs/jacksonville-jaguars-chants/move-those-chains/){:target="_blank"} for fans when the offense gets a first down.

Anyways, the site came about while I was testing a new design trend for a client. In the design community, there’s always new ideas to create better user experiences to help users consume content. The idea was to create full-height content sections that “snap” or fix to the screen’s viewport when a particular section is scrolled to. Once that was implemented, I figured it would be cool to showcase the recent draft picks using this technique.

In addition to the full-height snap panels, I added a layered animation effect on the players’ images, using images like the Jacksonville city skyline and the Jaguars stadium, that move horizontally in the background. There are also some other cool techniques used, but the idea here was to create that full-screen experience, where each section is like it’s own page and the information is simple to follow and easy to digest.

All content, images, logos and player bios are courtesy of the NFL and the Jacksonville Jaguars.
