> Here are 4 mistakes you don't want to make on social media.

### Mistake #1: Posting Facebook content through API services

Facebook is very focused on user experience and wants members to engage with a vivid and diverse Top News feed. Per Facebook’s EdgeRank Algorithm, the lowest weight is given to Applications. Hootsuite, Tweetdeck, and other self-publishers use the 3rd Party API to provide their members the ability to post to Facebook Pages without going onto the site itself. We recommend manually posting content on Facebook, rather than via a 3rd Party API publisher like Tweetdeck and Hootsuite, which can increase viewership by as much as 300%!

If you have the choice, by all means do not use Tweetdeck or Hootsuite to schedule Facebook posts! Read details about Facebook’s EdgeRank formula here.

 

### Mistake #2: Linking Facebook page with Twitter account

Twitter and Facebook are two distinct networks with two distinct sets of etiquette. The culture of both networks is different, so if you combine them you risk alienating your audience. By posting tweets to a Facebook page, you’ll submerge your Facebook community with status update after status update, taking over their newsfeed and appearing spammy. Also, the syntax for both networks is very different! Twitter relies on “#”s and “@”s to function and uses abbreviations like “RT”, while Facebook’s syntax is less niche. If your fill up your Facebook wall with status updates from Twitter, your Facebook community will quickly become annoyed.

 

### Mistake #3: Delayed response times & deleting a negative response

I believe all brands should take a lesson from the fast food industry and consider your response time as a valuable success metric. Social media provides a platform for your brand to be discussed and it gives users a reason to interact with your brand. The most important step is to listen to those customers and respond accordingly. Simple recognition is a great way to make a fan feel incorporated into your brand’s experience and it can go a long way!

Responding to negative comments is trickier, but can be equally rewarding for your brand. DO NOT delete a negative comment, unless it is truly spam or is offensive. Chances are, if a person left a paragraph complaint on your page, they spent a great deal of time organizing their thoughts and expressing their true feelings. Instead of rushing to delete the comment, take this as the new “suggestion box” in stores. Listen to user’s complaints and provide clear, effective solutions that can help turn frustration into appreciation.

 

### Mistake #4: Not having a frequently updated blog/news section

The best way to generate a high SERP (search engine result page) is to create great content over and over again. Whether this is done with an attractive blog, or through optimized social media content, Google and other search engines alike weigh their system the highest based on valuable and reoccurring content. Set up a blog for your brand or business and make a goal to update it once a week! Trust me… you will enjoy the treats!
