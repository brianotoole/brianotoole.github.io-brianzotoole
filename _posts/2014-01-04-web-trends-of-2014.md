> 2014 is going to be an awesome year for developers & designers. Here's my prediction of which trends are here to stay.

### 1. Content-Focused Responsive Design

2013 brought about responsive design, or repositioning desktop sites into viewable content for handheld devices. While the responsive design approach is great for most purposes, mobile users are typically on the go and without WiFi. This means, your site must have a low-bandwidth latency and be easily consumed. You must get information to a user as fast as possible and in fewer swipes. To do so, consider a content focused mobile layout… not just a responsive one.

### 2. Continuous Scrolling

Fargone is the term, “above the fold.” While continuous and parallax scrolling on websites became popular in 2013, we believe it is here to stay. Scrolling is an essential user experience aspect to consider while planning any website design. If used properly, it can help tell a story and provide a more engaging user experience by using multiple backgrounds a layering, 3D effect. Don’t fear scrolling. It is a normal user behavior. With apps like Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest all using continuous scrolling, we have only seen the beginning of this trend.

### 3. Hero Areas Will Replace Sliders

The average visitor’s attention span has decreased and no longer will to show them the information they need. Over the years, data has shown it’s typically only the first slider that generates clicks. Taking its place, is a pictorial introduction area with very little text, a full-width background image, and CSS3 animations to help stimulate the experience. The key to doing this section right is great art direction and beautiful photography.

### 4. Less is More

Minimalism in web design is used to add emphasis to content by removing unnecessary, distracting design elements. The focus is on succinct content and establishing one important piece of information as the focal point for the entire page. Design techniques combine a balance of larger typefaces and more white-space, creating a simpler user experience. Keep it stupid simple. Keep it low-bandwidth. Whitespace is your friend.

Examples: [Medium](https://www.medium.com/){:target="_blank"}, [LOWERCASE capital](https://lowercasecapital.com/){:target="_blank"}

### 5. The Instagram Effect

Vintage-style photos, color overlays, and blurred, full-width background images provide a great way to add a unique personalization to website aesthetics. The trend is most known from the popularity of Instagram filters, but has been a part of web design for years and will remain a key aspect of design for years to come.

### 6. App-like Interfaces for Web

With the growing number of mobile devices, more and more websites will continue to use a “mobile first” design approach. With simplicity and ease of use, mobile patterns such as slide out menus, fixed navigation and larger navigation, this trend will evolve and dominate 2014. Users don’t want to look and read. They want to look and do. Interfaces that feel more like a full-scale application will dominate this year.
