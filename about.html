    <p>I help businesses and startups capture brand recognition using modern technology and design. I have 10+ years of experience working with creative services and currently work at a full-service ad agency in Florida. I've worked alongside talented teams of designers, developers, and entrepreneurs, which has helped me develop a deep understanding about the intuitions of brand marketing.</p>

    <p>I sincerely enjoy the work I do and my clients garner the benefits. I am located in Tampa, Florida and love working with clients all over the USA. Outside of work, I like to explore new things and keep up with sports... particularly the NFL. <a href="http://bigcatcountry.com" target="_blank">Go Jags!</a></p>
