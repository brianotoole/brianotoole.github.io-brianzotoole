    <p>My name is Brian O'Toole and I am a director of web development living in Tampa, Florida. I help brands build recognition using the latest in web development and creative strategy. I believe good design should provide a low-bandwidth, meaningful user experience.</p>
    <p>I have 10+ years of experience working with creative services and work at a full-service ad agency. I've worked alongside talented teams of designers, developers, and entrepreneurs, which has helped me develop a deep understanding about the intuitions of brand marketing.</p>
    <p>I sincerely enjoy the work I do and my clients garner the benefits. Outside of work, I like to explore new things and keep up with sports... particularly the NFL. <a href="http://bigcatcountry.com?ref=brianzotoole.com" target="_blank">Go Jags!</a></p>
